Avengers:The Ironman
I love You 3000
The MCU followed co-creator Stan Lee's mindset upon creating Iron Man in the '60s - create a character who's not meant to be liked, and yet people can root for. This was perfectly established by Favreau in Iron Man where we met the reckless, narcissistic billionaire who was blind to the fact that his tech was being sold to both sides of a conflict without him knowing. Even after his time in captivity in Afghanistan, Tony didn't magically overhaul himself - in fact, he got more insufferable in Iron Man 2. He remained an egomaniac for the most part of his MCU stint, but that doesn't mean he wasn't a good man and certainly not less of a hero. If anything, he worked doubly hard to do good by the people he swore to protect when he assumed the mantle of Iron Man.
